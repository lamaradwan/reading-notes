## Iâ€™ve reviewed the following topics:

1. Random Module
It is a module that implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

For integers, uniform selection from a range. For sequences, uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.

On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian), lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. For generating distributions of angles, the von Mises distribution is available.

2. Risk analysis and Test Coverage

Using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.


3. Dependency Injection
Dependency injection is supplying a workflow with one of its subordinate parts.
Let's say you have a workflow or an object, TheMechanic. And you can tell TheMechanic to Fix() things. And he does it with a IronWrench. Normally you wouldn't care what tool he uses to Fix(), only that he does fix things. Internally, he will Fix() things using his own IronWrench.


## Things I want to know more about
