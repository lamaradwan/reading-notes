ReactJS is a free, open-source Javascript library for creating user interfaces, especially single-page apps. It's a website or web application that interacts with visitors by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server.

ReactJS isn't a framework in the traditional sense. It is simply a library created by Facebook to address some of the issues we have when creating UI components.

ReactJs has some of the best documentation, making it a lot easier to work with.

The reason why you should use ReactJs for your project:

- Easy Scripting
- Modular Design

- SEO-Friendly
- Higher-Quality in Less-Time
