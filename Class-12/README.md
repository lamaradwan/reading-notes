## Iâ€™ve reviewed the following topic:

1. Pandas
Pandas in general is a popular Python-based data analysis toolkit which can be imported using import pandas as pd. It presents a diverse range of utilities, ranging from parsing multiple file formats to converting an entire data table into a NumPy matrix array. This makes pandas a trusted ally in data science and machine learning.

Similar to NumPy, pandas deals primarily with data in 1-D and 2-D arrays

Also, we can do the following with pandas:
- Data cleansing.
- Data fill.
- Data normalization.
- Merges and joins.
- Data visualization.
- Statistical analysis.
- Data inspection.
- Loading and saving data.


## Things I want to know more about
1. Work on the pandas more to get the full idea
