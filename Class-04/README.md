# Class-04
## I’ve reviewed the following topics:

1. Classes and Objects

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.

Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

2. Thinking recursively

Recursive Function in Python is used for repetitively calling the same function until the loop reaches the desired value during the program execution by using the divide and conquer logic. One of the obvious disadvantages of using a recursive function in the Python program is ‘if the recurrence is not a controlled flow, it might lead to consumption of a solid portion of system memory. For rectifying this problem, an incremental conditional loop can be used in place of the Recursive function in a python programming language.

Recursion is different from iteration; it doesn’t scale up like an iterative method.



3. Pytest Fixture

Fixtures are basically a set of resources that have to set up before the test starts and have to be cleaned up after the execution of tests is complete. It contains a lot of improvements over the classic implementation of setup & teardown functions. The main advantages of using fixtures are

- You can set the lifetime & scope of the fixture. The scope of the implemented fixture could be modules, functions, classes, or the entire project.
- Fixtures are implemented in a modular manner; hence there is no learning curve involved.
