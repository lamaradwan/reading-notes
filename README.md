![Notes Image](https://www.kibrispdr.org/dwn/4/post-it-note-png.jpg)
In this site I'm writing my notes from the reading tasks, sharing my knowledge from anything is **catching my eye**.

Also maybe I can share here the following:
- My thoughts about any topic I read
- My opinion after reading the topics and the lesson that I've learn

## Code 102 - Intro to Software Development
## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development
## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development
## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development
