## Iâ€™ve reviewed the following topics:

1. List comprehension
- List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists.
- List comprehension is generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.
However, we should avoid writing very long list comprehensions in one line to ensure that code is user-friendly.

2. Primer on Python Decorators
A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
- Functions --> a function returns a value based on the given arguments.

In functional programming, you work (almost) only with pure functions without side effects. While not a purely functional language, Python supports many of the functional programming concepts, including functions as first-class objects.

- Simple Decorators --> decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior.
