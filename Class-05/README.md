I've reviewed the linked lists topic

Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked lists have some characteristics:

1. Data is not stored in contiguous memory space, but rather distributed.
2. The linked list has 2 parts - a)stores data and b) stores pointer(which links to the next memory space).
3. Needs more space as it stores pointer with data as well.

We have three types of linked lists:

1.single linked list

2. Double linked list

3. Circular linked list

Advantages of Linked Lists:-

They are dynamic in nature and allocate the memory when required.
Insertion and deletion operations can be easily implemented.
Stacks and queues can be easily executed.
Linked List reduces the access time.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists:-

The memory is wasted as pointers require extra memory for storage.
No element can be accessed randomly; it has to access each node sequentially.
Reverse Traversing is difficult in a linked list.
