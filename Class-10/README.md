## Iâ€™ve reviewed the following data structure topics:

1. Stacks
It's a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous. First In Last Out, which means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.


The main operations on it is:
- Push - put into the stack
- Pop - removed from the stack, When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.


2. Queues
It's the same as Stacks but First In First Out, which means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

The main operations as the following: 
- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
