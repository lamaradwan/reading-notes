-  Introduction to Django

Django is a free and open-source back-end web development framework based on Python. It has everything that developers need for backend functionalities. It doesn’t require you to do a lot of coding while building web apps. Being developed in a fast-paced newsroom environment, it enables developers to build apps quickly.

Industry leaders are using Django to build all sorts of things- from social networks to Content Management System (CMS) to the scientific computing platform. It’s a good fit for you if you have to build large applications. However, using Django for smaller applications may not be a good idea, as it can overload your small projects with unnecessary features.

Features:

It takes care of all your web development tasks, including site maps, RSS feeds, content administration, user authentication and more.
With its command-line utilities to create, you can automatically create database tables.
It enables you to design your own models and solve your database schema issues.
Once you define your model, it can automatically create a profound and production-ready admin interface.
It provides you the following security features:
1. Protecting you from XXS attack, meaning when an attacker sends malicious code to different end-users, by using a web application.

2. Protecting you from CSRF attack, meaning an attack that persuades end-users to execute unwanted actions (like clicking on any event) on the website in which they are the authorized user.

3. Protecting you from SQL injection. This is an attack that results in data leakage or deleted data.
