## Iâ€™ve reviewed the following topic:

1. scikit-learn and linear regression


Scikit-learn or Sklearn is the open-source python library useful in machine learning for predictive data analysis.

It is built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib, that means, it has library such as NumPy, SciPy and many more which makes our work easier with arrays and machine learning techniques.

It comes with a number of tools for data preprocessing, model selection and model evaluation including regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

While linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

## Things I want to know more about
1. Dig deeper into the machine learning to get the full understanding about the method inside it
