## I’ve reviewed the following topics:

1. The Big O notation

To see how efficient your algorithm is, since it is difficult to calculate how fast your algorithm is and Big O tells us the algorithm is what order.

Thus, the Big-O notation is a way to express the efficiency of an algorithm. If you’re going to be working with code, it is extremely important to understand Big-O. It is, quite literally, the used language to express efficiency.



2. Python 3 Module of the Week

It's explaing the concepts of Python which is very important to go on practicing more of Python. PyMOTW-3 is a series of articles written by Doug Hellmann. to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python 3 standard library. It is based on the original PyMOTW series, which covered Python 2.7.

## Things I want to know more about
