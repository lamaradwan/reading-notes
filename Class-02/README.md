## I’ve reviewed the following topics:

1. Python Lists and Strings

A string is a fundamental data type which represents an ordered sequence of one or more characters, in Python it's called **str**

Lists in python are mutable. we can add new values and delete old ones. we can slice it. we can change values we already stored in it.
While we have another type of lists it's the tuple and it's immutable. which means we can not add new values and delete old ones. we can slice it. we can not change values we already stored in it.


2. Python Modules and Packages

Module is a file which contains various Python functions and also global variables. It is simply just .py extension file which has python executable code. On the other hand , Package is nothing but a collection of modules. It must contains __init__.py file to let the python interpreter know this is not just simple directory but a collection of modules or package. Basically you don’t have to write anything in __init__.py file but must be there in the module directory.

Python Packages are supposed to enable us build our recommendation algorithms. If we have a simple problem, clean data & the answers we demand are simple as well, we can use scikit-learn and use primitive regression algorithmns.

3. Pytest

Pytest is a unit test framework for python. it will provide us with ways to run test cases, normally test cases, control things like doing setup and cleanup for each test case, or group/class of test cases, controlling which test runs before the other, etc and generating n8ce HTML reports after tests are run. 

## Things I want to know more about
