## I’ve reviewed the following topics:

1. Numpy

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
Also, The Jupyter Notebook has become ubiquitous with the rapid growth of data science and machine learning and the rising popularity of open-source software in industry and academia

### Operations using NumPy
Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −

- Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

- Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

- Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

2. JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.
