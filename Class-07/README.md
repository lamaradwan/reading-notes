## I’ve reviewed the following topic:

- Python Scope
The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in the code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code. The scope of a name or variable depends on the place in your code where you create that variable. The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the LEGB rule.

#### LEGB rule:

1. Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. 

2. Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function.

3. Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. 

4. Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.
