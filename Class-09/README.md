## I’ve reviewed the following topics:

1. Dunder methods

The dunder methods are how Python implements operators on classes.

Each operator (including the maths operators, logical operators, bitwise operators) have their own specific magic methods which can be implemented on custom classes if desired. You can also customise how your class responds to a number of built-in functions, including len, int, float, complex, hash, bool, str, repr

Dunder methods also exist to allow customisation of instance creation and deletion, and finally there are dunder methods that can be implemented so that your classes respond like iterables, containers, mappings and other key Python protocols

2. Statistics — Mathematical statistics functions in Python
Provides a built in methods for calculating the following:

- Averages and measures of central location
- Measures of spread
- Statistics for relations between two inputs



## Things I want to know more about
1. Dig deeper in the statistics methods
