## Iâ€™ve reviewed the following data structure topic:

1. Trees

In my reading there was three types of trees: 

- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- K-ary Trees

Any tree is containing the following:
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf


**There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:**

1. Depth First
- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root


2. Breadth First
- Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
