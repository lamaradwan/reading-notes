Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

This is a great exercise for web scraping beginners who are looking to understand how to web scrape. Web scraping can be slightly intimidating, so this tutorial will break down the process of how to go about the process.

## Important notes about web scraping:
1. Read through the website’s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
2. Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.
